# Steam Hook

> Announce your Steam achievements to a Slack channel

## Development instructions

We use Python and `uv` because we're cool like that. Make sure you have those things installed, and then

```bash
# Create the venv (be sure to then update the interpreter path in VSCode)
uv sync
# Run the app!
uv run flask --app steam_hook run --debug
```

## Roadmap

### v1

- [ ] Achievement tracking
- [ ] Slack integration (webhooks)
- [ ] Some way to configure it (web UI probably)

### Later (perhaps)

- [ ] Configuration from within Slack (Slack app)
- [ ] Discord support
- [ ] Playtime tracking
  - "MMK21 has been playing Terraria for 1 hour!" kind of thing?
